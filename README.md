# ToniOS

A very simple 32-bit i386 based OS with a simple monolithic kernel.

## About

This is a very simple OS that I have been developing to learn more about
assembly and low level C. It is designed to work on an i3 86 system, taking
full advantage of the extended registers. 

It follows a monolithic kernel 
design written in C. As well as a 16bit bootloader capable of booting with
a BIOS. 

A UEFI booting system, as well as other procesor architectures/platforms are 
and will not be supported.
